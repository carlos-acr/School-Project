# School-Project

This was a final project for my intro to web design course. 
This was my first website I ever created.
I chose to do a mockup of a restaurant website. The entire website was created
using Dreamweaver. I added forms for events, reservations, and careers. I used 
high quality images, and created the menus using InDesign.
